# A Barebones 3D Game Engine/Renderer in C and SDL 3

This is a very basic 3D rendering engine built in C, its single threaded and uses SDL3 so is purely CPU bound, as it is intended as an exploration rather than a product.

I started this project for two reasons, the first being that I knew some C but wanted to get a better understanding of how to write it and the second being as a challenge to my mathematics education. As such it started out very very simply and has gradually become more optimised, however it is still far from perfect, so if you have any suggestions or contributions feel free to create a PR and I'll take a look at what you've done :)
